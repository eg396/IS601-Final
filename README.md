# Reflection

This final project was one that was truly intimidating for me. I do feel that to an extent I was able to accomplish a lot, however I also believe that I could have accomplished a lot more with this than I wanted to. I do want to keep working on this as long as possible, despite the time issue (it's due tonight), however at the moment I feel quite ill so I intend to pick this up tomorrow and keep working as much as I can.

I did very much appreciate what I learned in this class - I feel that this project is an example of my rapidly expanding skills as a software developer. I have dealt with a huge number of unique problems to solve each time I did an assignment, and as a result I have grown more throughtful about full-stack development.
